L2 Cache Clock Controller

The L2 Cache Clock Controller provides clock, power domain, and
reset control to a L2-cache for a cluster. There is L2CCC register
region per CPU Cluster.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Can be one of:
		"qcom,8994-l2ccc"
		"qcom,8916-l2ccc"
		"qcom,msm8996-l2ccc"
- reg:		This specifies the base address and size of
		the register region.

Optional properties:
- reg:		For "qcom,8994-l2ccc only", an optional second tuple specifies
		the shared common base address required to trigger the L2 SPM
		out of power collapse.
		For "qcom,msm8996-l2ccc" only, an optional second tuple
		specifies the address of the CLKSEL register for the cluster.
- qcom,cbf-clock-peer: For "qcom,msm8996-l2ccc" only, a phandle to a peer
                "qcom,msm8996-l2ccc" node, which shares a common CBF clock
		source.
- qcom,cbf-clock-seq: For "qcom,msm8996-l2ccc" only, specify this to
		temporarily select the CBF clock source while powering up the
		L2. If present, the CLKSEL "reg" tuple must also be specified
		for this node and in the "cbf-clock-peer" node.  The
		"cbf-clock-peer" node is required in such cases, as well.
- qcom,vctl-node: Reference to a node that controls the power rails for the
 cluster.
- qcom,vctl-val: The voltage control register value that must be set before
		the caches can be turned on. This would be a required property
		if the target necessitates a voltage rail be turned on before
		turning on the cache.
- qcom,clamped-reset-seq: For "qcom,msm8996-l2ccc" only, specify this to
		apply an alternate L2 reset sequence, which repeatedly toggles
		the reset signal while clamps are enabled.

Example:

	clock-controller@f900f000 {
		compatible = "qcom,8994-l2ccc"";
		reg = <0xf900f000 0x1000>,
			<0xf911210c 0x4>;
		qcom,vctl-node = <&cluster_node>;
		qcom,vctl-val = <0xb8>;
	}
