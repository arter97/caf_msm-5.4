EHCI

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should contain "qcom,ehci-host"
- regs:			offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- usb-phy:		phandle for the PHY device

Example EHCI controller device node:

	ehci: ehci@f9a55000 {
		compatible = "qcom,ehci-host";
		reg = <0xf9a55000 0x400>;
		usb-phy = <&usb_otg>;
	};

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,android-usb"

Optional properties :
- reg  : offset and length of memory region that is used by device to
  update USB PID and serial numbers used by bootloader in DLOAD mode.
- qcom,android-usb-swfi-latency : value to be used by device to vote
  for DMA latency in microsecs.

Example Android USB device node :
	android_usb@fc42b0c8 {
		compatible = "qcom,android-usb";
		reg = <0xfc42b0c8 0xc8>;
		qcom,android-usb-swfi-latency = <1>;
